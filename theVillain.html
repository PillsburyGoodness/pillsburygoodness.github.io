		<p>
			Toc-Man's first appearance in the 'Pac-Man World' series is in the series' first game, 'Pac-Man World 1'. 
			In the first game, Toc-Man is the antagonist. 
			Much like Bowser to Mario in the popular 'Mario Bros.' series, Toc-Man sends his minions to kidnap Pac-Man's family and friends. 
			With Pac-Man's friends and family in tow, Toc-Man throws a party to overthrow Pac-Man and take his place. 
			In order to find what happens to this version of Toc-Man, you will have to play the game yourself!
		</p>
		<p>
			This version of Toc-Man is getting a revival in the upcoming game, 'Pac-Man World, Repac,' a remake of the first 'Pac-Man World' game. 
			Now is a perfect time to revist or play for the first time the game which gave life to Toc-Man.
